One of my recent favourite technologies is Temporal. It's 

`durable execution platformâ€”a modern toolkit for building resilient, long-running workflows in a code-centric, scalable way.`

Basically, it helps engineers build a reliable workflow by providing ways to retry, resume, and replay the execution at the desired point in time.
